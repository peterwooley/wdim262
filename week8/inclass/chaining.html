						<h3><a href="/archives/like-obama-for-web-design">Like Obama for Web Design</a></h3>

						<p>This evening, I had the pleasure of hearing friend and colleague <a href="http://tylersticka.com">Tyler Sticka</a> speak at <a href="http://www.devgroupnw.org/">DevGroup NW</a>, a Portland-based Adobe User Group that, among other things, sponsors the Portland <a href="http://webvisionsevent.com/">Web Visions</a> conference. Tyler's presentation, aptly titled <a href="http://www.tylersticka.com/2008/02/27/this-is-not-a-graphic-design/">This is Not a Graphic Design</a>, focused on the Web as a media revolution—not simply an extension of Graphic Design into a distributed model, but a much larger and more universal medium than has come before.</p>

<p>The crowd was larger than I had expected and many were genuinely intrigued by this separation of the Web into its own realm. A couple sitting in front of me passed a notebook back and forth, jotting down endless references: "<a href="http://w3.org">Accessibility!</a>",  "<a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr">SIFR</a>", and even "<a href="http://lcdsoundsystem.com">LCD Soundsystem</a>". Other notepads were a-flurry, and several eyes were literally glued (well, enough that my staring at them had no effect on their attention).</p>

<p>As the presentation delved deeper, starting from the beginnings of photography, through radio and television, and a host of other revolutions, Tyler was truly enjoying the experience, as were we the listeners. Around the half-way point, we were stopped to participate in a Shooter (as in gun) Drill, where we locked the doors, and sat quietly, making sure no one could hear us from beyond the room; this while the projected slide sat lit against the screen, featuring a screaming woman pulling her hair out over her Web browser options, which stood ominously above her. As the lights sprung to life, so did Tyler, with a joke and continuation into, what I've dubbed, the Why-Having-Multiple-Browsers-Doesn't-Suck section.</p>

<p>Following the hour long presentation, I was surprised to see the questions people were posing. Living in the world of passionate Web developers as I do, I often forget that Web Standards, accessibility, layout, and typography are still rather new concepts. Many solid, helpful questions were asked and answered: "How does SIFR fit into Web Standards?", because it uses unobtrusive JavaScript and Flash; "What's this MovableType?", simply a Content Management system, along with WordPress (good) and Joomla (bad); "I love accessibility, can Flash be accessible?", lean on Flash when it solves a problem Flash should solve, lean on HTML/CSS/JavaScript otherwise.</p>

<p>I took only one note through the entire event (not to say I didn't learn anything, I just forgot I had my notepad): <strong>He's like Obama for the Web</strong>. While he may not be campaigning for President of the World Wide Web Consortium, he is certainly proclaiming change—a change towards Standards, a change to how Typography is handled on the Web, and change for the overall good of the Web. Which, most certainly, is not a graphic design.</p>

						<h3><a href="/archives/infusing-meaning-into-the-web">Infusing Meaning into the Web</a></h3>

						<blockquote><p>Meaning is a necessity of design and nearly all Web design, at present, is meaningless. Web designs (and designers, therein) oft favor aesthetics over meaning, negating a key element that makes design design. Through atrocious mark-up, inaccessible functionality, and poorly conceived content, the Web and its humble designers show their infancy. Thankfully, all is not lost. Purposed concepts, such as Tim Berners-Lee's Semantic Web, and the continued growth of the Web as a viable business option coupled with better education for and from Web professionals may usher in both meaning and aesthetics to the World Wide Web.</p></blockquote>
<p>Continue reading my essay, <a href="http://peterwooley.com/essays/meaninglessWebDesign.pdf">Meaningless Web Design</a>, as I delve into why conveying meaning is such an integral part of design, and why delivering it should not be limited to just human agents; where the Web is headed with Tim Berners-Lee at the helm; and why and how we can breath life back into textual Web content. Together, perhaps, we'll be able to make the Web faster, stronger, better.</p>
