		</ul>
		
		<h2>Midterm Practical</h2>
		<p>To complete the Practical portion of the WDIM262 Midterm, please write a script that accomplishes the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Asks the user which Web browser is their favorite (of three options you define), accepting both the full title or numeric position in the list you define,
				<ul>
					<li>i.e., if you present the user with "Choose: IE, Firefox, or Safari", the user can either enter "Firefox" or "2" to choose Firefox.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Continues to ask the user which browser is their favorite, until a valid answer has been given,</li>
			<li>Dynamically creates an &lt;h1&gt; tag with the title of the browser they chose,</li>
			<li>Dynamically creates an &lt;img&gt; tag in the document that features the user's chosen Web browser logo,
				<ul>
					<li>Yes, that means you'll need to find images on the Internet. If the network is down, let me know!</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>And, lastly, no content may appear on the page if JavaScript is disabled in the user's browser, except for a message alerting the user they should enable JavaScript to view the content.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>When Finished</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Please zip up the file with this naming convention: <var>lastnameFirstname_midterm.zip</var>.</li>
			<li>Then place this file on the Data drive in a folder with a weird name, tell me which folder it is, and I'll grab it, and delete it from the drive.</li>
		</ul>
