		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		
		<p>Create a Web page that uses event handlers and the DOM to interact with the user in a few specific ways. Make sure it fulfills these requirements:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>When the page loads, the user is greeted in some way.</li>
			<li>When the page unloads, the user is bid farewell in some way.</li>
			<li>When a user clicks on a link on the page the link text changes and the page does not go to the link's href location.</li>
			<li>When a user's mouse enters a &lt;div /&gt; defined on the page, the div's background color changes.</li>
			<li>When a user's mouse leaves the afore-mentioned &lt;div /&gt;, the background color changes back.</li>
			<li>Lastly, when the user resizes the window, they are alert()ed that their action was successful.</li>
